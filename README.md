## Game Description

The game is intended for small children learning to type on the keyboard. The app presents an image and a text describing the image. The child then has to type that text in the input field below.

With every correct letter, the color of the text stays purple. However, if a wrong character is typed, the text turns red.

Once all the characters are correctly typed. The field is locked and a little award and a "new game" button appears below.

Since the keyboard letters are all in uppercase. There is a "uppercase checkbox" in the settings box to change the text to uppercase for those who haven't mastered lower- and uppercased letters yet.

## Tech

This app was made as part of my assignment in a React course.
It is my solution to demonstrate my basic knowledge of React and the React Hook system and was made with the help of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
